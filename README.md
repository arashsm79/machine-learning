* [Clustering Algorithms](https://github.com/arashsm79/machine-learning/tree/main/clustering-algorithms):
Clustering the ORL dataset using DBSCAN, K-Means, Agglomerative (Single Link, Complete Link, Group Average) and evaluating the results using rand index implemented from scratch.

* [Perceptron and Kernel Methods](https://github.com/arashsm79/machine-learning/tree/main/perceptron-and-kernel-methods): 
Running perceptron on the airline satisfaction dataset and experimenting with kernel methods using an implementation of kernelized perceptron from scratch and kernel approximation.
